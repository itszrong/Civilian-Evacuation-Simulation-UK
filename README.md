- **Scalable Architecture**: Async processing with configurable concurrency

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn
- uv (Python package manager) - install with: `pip install uv`

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Civilian-Evacuation-Simulation-UK

# Setup all dependencies (Python + Node.js + Services)
make setup
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.template .env

# Configure required environment variables
# - OpenAI API key (for AI features)
# - Twilio credentials (for notifications)
# - Other service configurations
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Option 1: Start all services (recommended)
make services

# Option 2: Start backend and frontend only
npm run build && npm run start

# Option 3: Start individual services
make run          # Backend only
make run_ui       # Frontend only

# Access application
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Available Commands

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile with the following commands:

```bash
make setup         # Install all dependencies (Python + Node.js + Services)
make services      # Start ALL services (RSS, DSPy, Backend, Frontend)
make run           # Start the FastAPI backend server
make run_ui        # Start the React frontend
make test          # Run tests for both backend and frontend
make clean         # Clean up build artifacts and caches
make help          # Show all available commands
```
